# RGB To CMYK Colour Converter (React.js)

## Summary
A personal project to explore and learn more React.js. This project takes in RGB values via a slider input and converts the colour to the CMYK colour space.

## To Do's
I'd like to expand this project to take on the following capabilities:
- ~~Equivalent HEX colour~~ (Completed April 29)
- ~~Add CSS rgb(0,0,0) format~~ (Completed April 29)
- Colour Swatch generator (Complementary, Split-Complementary, Triad Relationship, etc.)
- Other ideas as they come!
